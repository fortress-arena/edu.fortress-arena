When many people think of blockchain games, they think of Exy Infinity or Crypto Kitty. However, it was Hunter Coin that came out in 2014 that started the blockchain game. Hunter Coin is very similar to Bitcoin, but with one difference, Hunter Coin only goes 10% back to miners and 90% goes to the game. The rule of the game was for game players to compete with other players in the game to obtain Hunter Coins, and it was a Bitcoin version of the game that once went well, with up to about 30,000 players. However, the gameplay was too simple, so it was easy for bots to work, and there was a downside that players couldn't constantly come in. After that, the life of the game ended and the crypto market also entered a dark period, and people thought that the crypto market would disappear and stopped looking for blockchain games for a while.","second_section_title":"The first NFT blockchain game utilized","second_section_desc":"Ethereum came out after 2014, and the platform blockchain was introduced, and as a result, FT and NFT were created. In particular, due to the non-replaceable nature of NFT, there was a lot of movement to use it in games, and several Ethereum games came out. But the most famous one came out at the end of 2017, a crypto kitty game that uses cat character NFTs to play a breeding game. The game itself was simple and the heat cooled down quickly, but I think it had a great impact on the crypto market as the maximum number of users per day exceeded 14,000 and the Crypto Kitty's breeding system still exists. The Crypto Kitty game still exists, but it is not a game that is currently played very much because of the lack of development of the game and the market situation.","third_section_title":"Full-fledged blockchain game","third_section_desc":"Crypto market will not revitalize until 2 years after another crisis in 2018. With the technology called NFT becoming more known to the public and technologies utilizing the stability of Ethereum emerging, Exy Infinity, which came out with a model called P2E, will play a leading role in this cycle of blockchain games. After Axi Infinity, many game companies began to announce the entry of blockchain, and games with a model of earning tokens (eg M2E) by performing specific actions such as X2E came out. Exy Infinity also had weaknesses like existing blockchain games, and it failed to overcome its weaknesses and failed to bring continuous gamers to the game. At the same time, the price of Ethereum has fallen so much that the market is not looking for crypto games again.","fourth_section_title":"Next blockchain game?","fourth_section_desc":"It seems like we have a similar cycle with a new blockchain game coming out every few years, but it's getting better in many aspects. It is evolving to be more and more compatible with the blockchain in games, and the quality of the game and the player side are also evolving. The current bad coin market is a great time to find a new blockchain game. I think we will witness another block-chain game trend in the year when the crypto market stops declining and becomes active again.","call_to_action":"We are making Fortress Arena, a Web3 game, and we need a lot of gamers who genuinely love the game. If you are interested in making the next blockchain game together, please join us on Discord and give us your opinions."},"titles":["Is P2E Dead?","When Cryptocurrency games become popular?","Next version of Steam in Web3 Gaming","P2E Android Game Trend in 2023","A Dynamic History of Blockchain Games"],"paths":["is-P2E-Dead","When-Cryptocurrency-Games-Become-Popular","Next-Version-of-Steam-in-Web3-Gaming","P2E-Android-Game-Trend-in-2023","A-Dynamic-History-of-Blockchain-Games"]},"__N_SSG":true}
