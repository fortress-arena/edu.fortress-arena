In Web 3, since blockchains are diverse, games such as Ethereum games, polygon games, and BNB games are fragmented, and even when games are released, they are not easily seen, so gamers can find new games only by searching Discord, Telegram, or Twitter. . Files shared on these channels are also vulnerable to hacking. These situations are similar to those of 20 years ago when people went to the Yongsan Electronics Market to buy game CDs or illegal image files were shared because CDs can be copied. The problems in the web 2 game market began to be resolved with the release of Steam.","second_section_title":"Steam solves web2 game problems","second_section_desc":"Steam has made it very simple for users to download and install games, and if a game patch is available, it can be updated with a single click. This allowed users to easily save and buy games through Steam, and increased users through various discount events. In Steam, news or community features are also activated, and it is currently an application used by over 100 million people.","third_section_title":"Web3 game market opens up new opportunities","third_section_desc":"Steam has become a very popular app, but it seems difficult for Steam to solve the problems of Web 3. Because it is so large, it has chosen to ostracize rather than solve its vexing regulatory problems. Steam's current policy is that P2E, NFT, or crypto games cannot be sold on Steam. The gaming market is always the first market for new technologies to be applied. Web 3 technologies using NFTs or tokens have been quickly applied to games, and the potential of web 3 games is also showing, but there is no web 3 game platform that solves the fragmentation and inconvenience of web 3 games like Steam.","fourth_section_title":"Features of the Web3 Game Platform","fourth_section_desc":"I think the Web 3 version of Steam will specialize in a few features. The first is game exchange with gamers. Game CDs from 20 years ago became NFTs, so games purchased by gamers are returned to gamers instead of a centralized platform. In other words, gamers can exchange for other games after playing enough games. In addition to games, items or goods made with NFTs can be exchanged. The second is that the game's data is more usable. Since Steam's video games are single-player, the data stored when playing is limited, but when using the blockchain, a web 3 technology, a lot of data is uploaded to the blockchain, so you can see what choices other players are making and what items they are holding. etc. is easier to see. Finally, features such as tokenomics and staking that were not used in Web 2 may be added. Since goods and items within Web 3 games will be tokenized, the platform will also provide a way to use the tokens outside the game.","call_to_action":"We are making Fortress Arena, a Web3 game, and we need a lot of gamers who genuinely love the game. If you want to create the web 3 game market together, please participate in the Discord and give your opinions."},"titles":["Is P2E Dead?","When Cryptocurrency games become popular?","Next version of Steam in Web3 Gaming","P2E Android Game Trend in 2023","A Dynamic History of Blockchain Games"],"paths":["is-P2E-Dead","When-Cryptocurrency-Games-Become-Popular","Next-Version-of-Steam-in-Web3-Gaming","P2E-Android-Game-Trend-in-2023","A-Dynamic-History-of-Blockchain-Games"]},"__N_SSG":true}
