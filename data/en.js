        first_section_title: 'Play to Earn games are for gamers',
        first_section_desc_1: 'P2E, which started with Axie infinity, has a view that P2E is over now as the number of users of Axie infinity decreases and the token price of AXS and SLP used in Axie infinity also goes down. However, in Web3 space, this view is often encountered. Is Bitcoin dead? Or is Ethereum over?',
        first_section_desc_2: 'There are countless Web3 projects and concepts that have died in the middle, but many have survived to the end. Like projects that survived by overcoming twists and turns, trying new things and changing, we believe that P2E is a concept that will continue to change and survive in the future. Web3\'s P2E has better benefits for game players, not game companies.',
        second_section_title: 'Wrong direction of P2E games',
        second_section_desc_1: 'However, many of the current P2E projects are showing fraud and token price pumping and dumping, which is repulsive to gamers who play games passionately. Also, since many P2E games aim to earn more tokens and increase the price of tokens, there is a point where they are merged with the wrong Web3 culture.',
        second_section_desc_2: 'Rocket images and To the Moon are everywhere within the game\'s communities on Discord and Telegram, but that\'s not where Web3 games should be headed. Adding Web3 features to richer gameplay in the fun games of Web2 is the next direction to go. For gamers, the most important thing is not tokens or NFTs, but games.',
        third_section_title: 'P2E is not a new concept',
        third_section_desc_1: 'P2E is actually a concept that existed in the existing game, Web2. In-game botting is created to earn money, and third-party apps are used to exchange items or in-game goods with others. In the case of MMORPGs, even if they are in-game goods that are not cashed in, they are played to earn materials for quests, and this can also be called P2E in a large frame. P2E itself is not a new concept, but the biggest reason Web3 P2E games came out was to decentralize the monopoly of games.',
        third_section_desc_2: 'The player\'s exchange of goods is gradually disappearing, and the structure in which the game company exclusively owns the supplier of goods in the game and takes all the profits from the Mystery Box system is the biggest problem of current games, and this can be solved in Web3 games. It is the strength of Web3 that game companies and players grow together and improve the degree of freedom of game play through Web3 features, and we think game companies that add Web3 features well will create games that will lead the next game industry.',
        fourth_section_title: 'What\'s next for P2E games?',
        fourth_section_desc_1: 'No matter how well you add Web3 features, the most important thing is that the game should be fun. In essence, games must be fun so that gamers can become part of the game community and enjoy the added Web3 features with various forms of P2E. The community of Web3 P2E games should be filled with gamers who are more curious about the content of the next updated game, rather than people who are worried about how much to earn and lose.',
        fourth_section_desc_2: 'P2E games in the future are not standardized games where you can go to a higher rank by spending more money, but we think the next step is for gamers to grow together as the game grows and to get back the right to supply goods in the game.돈을 더 많이 쓰면 상위 랭크로 갈 수 있는 획일화된 게임이 아니라 게이머도 게임이 성장할수록 같이 성장하며 게임 내의 재화의 공급 같은 권한도 게이머들이 다시 돌려받는 것이 다음 단계라고 생각합니다.',

        first_section_desc_1: 'In the crypto market, almost all coins tend to fall when Bitcoin or Ethereum drops significantly. Currently, the crypto market is experiencing a drop in most of coins, so the coin on the Web3 game side is also in a bad situation. But the market as a whole is not dead.',
        first_section_desc_2: 'According to DappRadar reports, Alien Worlds had close to 200,000 players in Q3, while gaming platform Gameta has nearly 2 million users. However, the number of gamers is not as high as that of Web2 games, and the expansion of gamers is not as fast as market expected.',
        second_section_title: 'Crypto game market attracting attention',
        second_section_desc_1: 'There aren\'t many Web3 gamers. The biggest reason is that current cryptocurrency games do not provide enough quality or fun to attract gamers.',
        second_section_desc_2: 'Although it is a Web3 game that does not provide good quality right now, I believe that blockchain will take game play to the next level in the future, just as the Internet has moved from single player to multiplayer game. For this reason, many crypto venture capitalists are paying attention to Web3 games, and many blockchain companies are participating in game conferences.',

        fourth_section_desc_1: 'When a high-quality game using blockchain comes out, you will definitely see many gamers in the Web3 game market. Of course, there are limitations of blockchain that need to be addressed before that. For example, the blockchain should be faster and the fees for using the blockchain should be much cheaper.',
        fourth_section_desc_2: 'And it should be easier to create an account on the blockchain that owns the items received in the game. On the blockchain, builders are solving technical limitations one by one that gamers will not feel uncomfortable with, and many things can be solved in 2023, so we think we may see the trend of crypto games in 2023.',

        first_section_desc_1: 'The web 3 game market in 2022 has problems with the early web 2 game market. In Web 3, since blockchains are diverse, games such as Ethereum games, polygon games, and BNB games are fragmented, and even when games are released, they are not easily visible, so gamers can find new games only by searching Discord, Telegram, or Twitter.',
        first_section_desc_2: 'Files shared on these channels are also vulnerable to hacking. This look is similar to what it looked like 20 years ago when you went to a retail shop to buy a game CD, or illegal image files were shared because CDs could be copied. The problems in the web 2 game market began to be resolved with the release of Steam.',
        second_section_title: 'Steam solved the problem of web2 games',
        second_section_desc_1: 'Steam has made it very simple for users to download and install games, and if a game patch is available, it can be updated with a single click.',
        second_section_desc_2: 'This allowed users to easily save and buy games through Steam, and increased users through various discount events. In Steam, news or community features are also activated, and it is currently an application used by over 100 million people.',
        third_section_title: 'Web3 game market opens up new opportunities',
        third_section_desc_1: 'Steam has become a very popular app, but it seems difficult for Steam to solve the problems of Web 3. Because it is so large, it has chosen to ostracize rather than solve its vexing regulatory problems. Steam\'s current policy is that P2E, NFT or crypto games cannot be sold on Steam.',
        third_section_desc_2: 'The gaming market is always the first market for new technologies. Web 3 technologies using NFTs or tokens have been quickly applied to games, and the potential of web 3 games is also showing, but there is no web 3 game platform that solves the fragmentation and inconvenience of web 3 games like Steam.',
        fourth_section_title: 'Characteristics of the web3 gaming platform',
        fourth_section_desc_1: 'Steam\'s Web 3 version will specialize in a few features. The first is game exchange with gamers. Game CDs from 20 years ago became NFTs, so games purchased by gamers are returned to gamers instead of saving in a centralized platform. In other words, gamers can exchange for other games after playing enough. In addition to games, items or goods made with NFTs can be exchanged.',
        fourth_section_desc_2: 'The second is that the game\'s data is more usable. Since Steam\'s video games are mostly for single-player, the data stored from playing is limited, but when using the blockchain, a web 3 technology, a lot of data is uploaded to the blockchain, so you can see what choices other players are making and what items they are holding. etc. is easier to see. Finally, features such as tokenomics and staking that were not used in Web 2 may be added. Since goods and items within Web 3 games will be tokenized, the platform will also provide ways to use the tokens outside the game.',

        second_section_title: 'Play with social login',
        second_section_desc_1: 'The first is increased accessibility. There are two major obstacles to accessibility in current P2E games. One is that you must own NFTs to play, and the other is that you need a wallet to own NFTs. In contrast to Android games where you can directly access the game by simply logging in with Google or Apple, we think P2E games in 2023 will change so that you can play the game directly with social login regardless of having NFT.',
        second_section_desc_2: 'Games like Free to Play or Free to Own will be transformed into games that will be as easy to play as existing Android games. Tokens or NFTs obtained while playing the game can be owned by creating a wallet.',
        third_section_title: 'Changes in NFT supply',
        third_section_desc_1: 'Second, the NFT supply method will change. The supply of characters in P2E games can be viewed positively in that the user has received the authority producing characters, not the gaming company. However, the character supply method of P2E in 2022 is a breeding system where two parent characters create one child character. No matter how much you limit the number of breeding in this method, the number of characters increases exponentially over time, and there will be more supply than the characters users want.',
        third_section_desc_2: 'Since the character is not unique, the fun is halved and the number of users is gradually decreasing, which is also a factor that shortens the life of the game. Therefore, in P2E in 2023, users have the right to supply, but we think that the supply method of characters will diversify and new trends will emerge from it.',
        fourth_section_title: 'The last puzzle of the P2E game',
        fourth_section_desc_1: 'Last but not least, games should be fun. Existing P2E games are played to make money rather than for fun. There is also a tendency to call existing P2E games as GameFi in the form of combining games with finance.',
        fourth_section_desc_2: 'The games that will be reorganized in 2023 will come out with a purpose for game rather than money. Regardless of NFTs and tokens\' price, it refers to games in which players buy in-game items and the number of players is large because the game is fun.',

However, it was Hunter Coin that came out in 2014 that started the blockchain game. Hunter Coin is very similar to Bitcoin, but with one difference, Hunter Coin only goes 10% back to the miners and 90% goes to the game. The rule of the game was for game players to compete with other players in the game to obtain Hunter Coins, and it was a Bitcoin version of the game that once went well, with up to about 30,000 players.',
        first_section_desc_2: 'However, the gameplay was too simple, so it was easy for bots to work, and there was a downside that players couldn\'t constantly come in. After that, the life of the game ended and the crypto market also entered a dark period, and people thought that the crypto market would disappear, and they stopped looking for blockchain games for a while.',
        second_section_title: 'The first NFT blockchain game to utilize',
        second_section_desc_1: 'After 2014, Ethereum came out and platform blockchain was introduced, resulting in FT and NFT. In particular, due to the non-replaceable nature of NFT, there was a lot of movement to use it in games, and several Ethereum games came out. However, the most famous one came out at the end of 2017, when a crypto kitty game that uses cat character NFTs to play a breeding game came out.',
        second_section_desc_2: 'The game itself was simple and its popularity quickly waned, but it had a great impact on the crypto market, considering that the maximum number of users per day is over 14,000 and that Crypto Kitty\'s breeding system still exists. The Crypto Kitty game is still alive, but it is not a game that is currently played a lot due to the lack of development of the game.',

        third_section_desc_1: 'The crypto market is only revitalized two years after another crisis in 2018. With the technology called NFT becoming more known to the public and technologies utilizing the stability of Ethereum emerging, Axie Infinity, which came out with a model called P2E, played a leading role in ths last cycle of blockchain games. After Axie Infinity, many game companies began to announce the entry of blockchain, and games with a model of earning tokens by performing specific actions such as X2E  (eg M2E) came out.',
        third_section_desc_2: 'However, Axie Infinity also had weaknesses like existing blockchain games, and failed to overcome its weaknesses to bring continuous gamers to the game.
