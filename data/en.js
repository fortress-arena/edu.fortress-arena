        first_section_title: 'Play to Earn games are for gamers',
        first_section_desc: 'P2E, which started with Exy Infinity, has a view that P2E is over now as the number of users of Exy Infinity and the token price of AXS and SLP used in Exy Infinity are also decreasing. However, in Web3, which deals with blockchain, this view is often encountered. Is Bitcoin Over? Or is Ethereum over? Web3 has tons of halfway projects and concepts, but a lot of them live on. I think P2E is a concept that will continue to be used in the future, just as we survived by overcoming twists and turns and trying new things and changing. Because Web3\'s P2E has better benefits for game players, not game companies.',
        second_section_title: 'The Wrong Direction of P2E Games',
        second_section_desc: 'However, many of the projects currently using P2E show endless scams and token price pumping before selling them to the market, which is repulsive to passionate gamers. Also, since many P2E games aim to earn more tokens and increase the price of tokens, there is a point where they are merged with the wrong Web3 culture. Rocket images and Gazza are chanting within the game\'s communities on Discord and Telegram, but that\'s not where Web3 games should be headed. Adding Web3 features to richer gameplay in the fun games of Web2 is the next direction to go. For gamers, the most important thing is the game, not tokens or NFTs.',
        third_section_title: 'P2E is not a new concept',
        third_section_desc: 'P2E is actually a concept that existed in the previous game, Web2. In-game workshops are created to earn money, and third-party apps are used to exchange items or in-game goods with others. In the case of MMORPGs, even if they are in-game goods that are not cashed in, they are played to earn materials for quests, and this can also be called P2E in a large frame. P2E itself is not a new concept, but I think the biggest reason Web3 P2E games came out was to decentralize the monopoly of games. The player\'s exchange of goods is gradually disappearing, and the structure in which the game company exclusively owns the supplier of goods in the game and enjoys all the profits from the gacha system is the biggest problem of current games, and this can be solved in Web3 games. It is the strength of Web3 that game companies and players grow together and improve the degree of freedom of game play through Web3 features, and I think game companies that add Web3 features well will create games that connect the next game industry.',
        fourth_section_title: 'What\'s next for P2E games?',
        fourth_section_desc: 'No matter how well you add Web3 features, the most important thing is that the game is fun. In essence, games must be fun so that gamers can become part of the game community and enjoy the added Web3 features while also enabling various forms of P2E. The community of Web3 P2E games should be filled with gamers who are more curious about the content of the next updated game, rather than people who are worried about how much to earn and lose. It\'s not a standardized game where you can go to a higher rank if you spend more money, but gamers grow as the game grows, and I think the next step is for gamers to get their rights back, such as the supply of goods in the game.',

        first_section_desc: 'In the crypto market, when Bitcoin or Ethereum drops significantly, almost all coins tend to fall. Currently, the crypto market is experiencing a drop in many coins, so the coin on the Web3 game side is also in a bad situation. But the market as a whole is not dead. According to DappRadar reports, Alien Worlds had close to 200,000 players in Q3, while gaming platform Gameta has nearly 2 million users. It\'s just that the number of gamers is not as high as that of Web2 games, and the expansion of gamers is not as fast.',
        second_section_title: 'Crypto Game Market Attention',
        second_section_desc: 'This is due to the lack of Web3 gamers, and the biggest reason is that the current cryptocurrency games do not provide enough quality or fun to attract gamers. Although it is a Web3 game that does not provide good quality right now, I believe that blockchain will take game play to the next level in the future, just as the Internet has moved from single player to multiplayer game. For this reason, many crypto venture capitalists are paying attention to Web3 games, and many blockchain companies are participating in game conferences.',
        third_section_title: 'Number of Investors > Number of Gamers',
        third_section_desc: 'A lot of money is currently flowing into Web3 gaming, and many game companies and game studios are investing and launching to create the games of the future. The Web3 gaming market has plenty of capital, but it lacks the most important gamers. To exaggerate, there are more investors than gamers.',
        fourth_section_title: 'Crypto Games in 2023',
        fourth_section_desc: 'If high-quality games using blockchain come out, we will definitely see many gamers in the Web3 game market. Of course, there are limitations of blockchain that need to be addressed before that. And it should be easier to create an account on the blockchain that owns the items received in the game. On the blockchain, we are solving technical limitations one by one that gamers will not feel uncomfortable with, and many things can be solved in 2023, so I think we may see the trend of crypto games in 2023.',

        first_section_title: 'Web3 games also have problems with web2 games',
        first_section_desc: 'The web 3 game market in 2022 has problems with the early web 2 game market. In Web 3, since blockchains are diverse, games such as Ethereum games, polygon games, and BNB games are fragmented, and even when games are released, they are not easily seen, so gamers can find new games only by searching Discord, Telegram, or Twitter. . Files shared on these channels are also vulnerable to hacking. These situations are similar to those of 20 years ago when people went to the Yongsan Electronics Market to buy game CDs or illegal image files were shared because CDs can be copied. The problems in the web 2 game market began to be resolved with the release of Steam.',
        second_section_title: 'Steam solves web2 game problems',
        second_section_desc: 'Steam has made it very simple for users to download and install games, and if a game patch is available, it can be updated with a single click. This allowed users to easily save and buy games through Steam, and increased users through various discount events. In Steam, news or community features are also activated, and it is currently an application used by over 100 million people.',
        third_section_title: 'Web3 game market opens up new opportunities',
        third_section_desc: 'Steam has become a very popular app, but it seems difficult for Steam to solve the problems of Web 3. Because it is so large, it has chosen to ostracize rather than solve its vexing regulatory problems. Steam\'s current policy is that P2E, NFT, or crypto games cannot be sold on Steam. The gaming market is always the first market for new technologies to be applied. Web 3 technologies using NFTs or tokens have been quickly applied to games, and the potential of web 3 games is also showing, but there is no web 3 game platform that solves the fragmentation and inconvenience of web 3 games like Steam.',
        fourth_section_title: 'Features of the Web3 Game Platform',
        fourth_section_desc: 'I think the Web 3 version of Steam will specialize in a few features. The first is game exchange with gamers. Game CDs from 20 years ago became NFTs, so games purchased by gamers are returned to gamers instead of a centralized platform. In other words, gamers can exchange for other games after playing enough games. In addition to games, items or goods made with NFTs can be exchanged. The second is that the game\'s data is more usable. Since Steam\'s video games are single-player, the data stored when playing is limited, but when using the blockchain, a web 3 technology, a lot of data is uploaded to the blockchain, so you can see what choices other players are making and what items they are holding. etc. is easier to see. Finally, features such as tokenomics and staking that were not used in Web 2 may be added. Since goods and items within Web 3 games will be tokenized, the platform will also provide a way to use the tokens outside the game.',

        first_section_title: 'Problems of existing P2E',
        first_section_desc: 'As many P2E games are planned for release in 2023 as in 2022. However, the games that were launched in 2022 had their own limitations, so the games to be released in 2023 will come out by complementing many problems. Then, what problems did the existing P2E games have and how will they be solved in the new P2E games?',
        second_section_title: 'Play with Social Login',
        second_section_desc: 'The first section is more accessible. There are two major obstacles to accessibility in current P2E games. One is that you must own NFTs to play, and the other is that you need a wallet to own NFTs. In contrast to Android games where you can directly access the game by simply logging in with Google, I think P2E games in 2023 will change so that you can play the game directly with social login regardless of NFT. Games like Free to Play or Free to Rent will be transformed into games that will be as easy to play as existing games. Tokens or NFTs obtained while playing the game can be owned by creating a wallet while playing the game, not at the start of the game.',
        third_section_title: 'Changes in NFT Supply',
        third_section_desc: 'Second, the NFT supply method will change. The supply of characters in P2E games can be viewed positively in that the user has received the authority that the game company has exclusively because the user has the authority. However, the character supply method of P2E in 2022 is a breeding system where two parent characters create one child character. No matter how much you limit the number of breeding in this method, the number of characters increases exponentially over time, and the supply of more than the characters that users want to play occurs. Since the character is not unique, the fun is halved and the number of users is gradually decreasing, which is also a factor that shortens the life of the game. Therefore, in P2E in 2023, users have the right to supply, but I think the supply method of characters will diversify and new trends will emerge from it.',
        fourth_section_title: 'The last puzzle of the P2E game',
        fourth_section_desc: 'Lastly and obviously, the game should be fun. Existing P2E games are played to make money rather than for fun. There is also a tendency to call existing P2E games as game pie in the form of combining games with finance. The games that will be reorganized in 2023 will come out with a purpose for game rather than money. Regardless of NFTs and tokens, it refers to games where the number of players is increasing because the game is fun, and the number of players is high, so the game is fun, so they also purchase in-game items.',

        first_section_desc: 'Blockchain games have a shorter history than you might think. When many people think of blockchain games, they think of Exy Infinity or Crypto Kitty. However, it was Hunter Coin that came out in 2014 that started the blockchain game. Hunter Coin is very similar to Bitcoin, but with one difference, Hunter Coin only goes 10% back to miners and 90% goes to the game. The rule of the game was for game players to compete with other players in the game to obtain Hunter Coins, and it was a Bitcoin version of the game that once went well, with up to about 30,000 players. However, the gameplay was too simple, so it was easy for bots to work, and there was a downside that players couldn\'t constantly come in. After that, the life of the game ended and the crypto market also entered a dark period, and people thought that the crypto market would disappear and stopped looking for blockchain games for a while.',
        second_section_title: 'The first NFT blockchain game utilized',
        second_section_desc: 'Ethereum came out after 2014, and the platform blockchain was introduced, and as a result, FT and NFT were created. In particular, due to the non-replaceable nature of NFT, there was a lot of movement to use it in games, and several Ethereum games came out. But the most famous one came out at the end of 2017, a crypto kitty game that uses cat character NFTs to play a breeding game. The game itself was simple and the heat cooled down quickly, but I think it had a great impact on the crypto market as the maximum number of users per day exceeded 14,000 and the Crypto Kitty\'s breeding system still exists. The Crypto Kitty game still exists, but it is not a game that is currently played very much because of the lack of development of the game and the market situation.',
        third_section_title: 'Full-fledged blockchain game',
        third_section_desc: 'Crypto market will not revitalize until 2 years after another crisis in 2018. With the technology called NFT becoming more known to the public and technologies utilizing the stability of Ethereum emerging, Exy Infinity, which came out with a model called P2E, will play a leading role in this cycle of blockchain games. After Axi Infinity, many game companies began to announce the entry of blockchain, and games with a model of earning tokens (eg M2E) by performing specific actions such as X2E came out. Exy Infinity also had weaknesses like existing blockchain games, and it failed to overcome its weaknesses and failed to bring continuous gamers to the game. At the same time, the price of Ethereum has fallen so much that the market is not looking for crypto games again.',
        fourth_section_title: 'Next blockchain game?',
        fourth_section_desc: 'It seems like we have a similar cycle with a new blockchain game coming out every few years, but it\'s getting better in many aspects. It is evolving to be more and more compatible with the blockchain in games, and the quality of the game and the player side are also evolving. The current bad coin market is a great time to find a new blockchain game. I think we will witness another block-chain game trend in the year when the crypto market stops declining and becomes active again.',
